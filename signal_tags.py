Signal Tags — watchlist categorization / badge system
=======================================================
Ported concept from the cup_test scanner's multi-category watchlist
(database.py: confirmed / on-the-verge / near-breakout / today / active /
historical), generalized to work across nse-scanner's 13 pattern
detectors instead of being Cup&Handle-specific.

cup_test derived its categories from Cup&Handle geometry (handle depth,
rim symmetry, etc). nse-scanner already has a pattern-agnostic composite
ranking system for exactly this purpose — score10 / tier, computed once
in scanner.py's main() from CANSLIM, RS percentile, risk:reward, volume
surge, Stage-2, Piotroski, pledge quality, etc — so tags here are derived
from THAT (same signal, any of the 14 pattern labels) rather than
re-deriving pattern-specific geometry.

Tags are additive: a single signal can carry several (e.g. a stock can be
both BUY_STRONG and MULTI_PATTERN and HIGH_CONVICTION at once). The
dashboard and watchlist both key off these tags for their category tabs.

    The strict "very high good pattern" gate — this is the NEW,
    separate list the person asked for, analogous to cup_test's
    Confirmed-Breakout tier but generalized: instead of Cup&Handle
    geometry (handle depth / rim symmetry) it gates on the fields
    every one of nse-scanner's 14 pattern labels already produces.

    Deliberately a hard AND of several independent checks (not just a
    single high score10) so one maxed-out component can't carry a
    mediocre setup into the list — mirrors cup_test's approach of
    combining a numeric score with explicit hard requirements.

    CALIBRATION NOTE: score10's theoretical ceiling is 10.0, but across
    a real 6,717-signal daily scan the observed max was 7.37 and only 6
    signals ever reached the codebase's own "BUY STRONG" tier (which
    scanner.py's _tier() defines as score10 >= 7.0) — score10 >= 8.0
    is not a stricter bar, it's an unreachable one. The gate below uses
    7.0 (the actual BUY STRONG boundary already defined in scanner.py)
    so this list can ever be non-empty, while the four independent
    checks alongside it still do real work: on that same scan, of the
    6 BUY STRONG signals, one (vol_surge 1.2x) was filtered out by the
    volume-surge gate — exactly the kind of case this is meant to catch.
