Explain — rule-based, per-signal prose generator for the HTML dashboard
=========================================================================
Ported from the cup_test scanner's explain.py. Converts one signal row
(a dict — a `signals` table record, or the equivalent df.iterrows()
Series.to_dict()) into human-readable prose: why the scanner flagged
this stock, what's attractive, what's risky, whether buying is
recommended, and a rule-by-rule PASS/FAIL/WARN breakdown.

cup_test's version traced every sentence back to Cup&Handle geometry
fields (cup depth, handle quality, rim symmetry). nse-scanner has no
single geometry model — it has 14 different pattern detectors — so this
version traces every sentence back to the SAME fields nse-scanner's own
score10 composite already uses (CANSLIM, RS percentile, risk:reward,
volume surge, TI65, Lynch score, Weinstein stage, volume dry-up,
Piotroski F-score, promoter pledge, bulk/block deals). That keeps the
same design principle: nothing here is invented — if a field is
missing, the corresponding sentence is simply omitted.
